# CNN-with-ResNet
Implementation of CNN using ResNet (in PyTorch)


In this project I have implemented CNN along with ResNet.
I have used the classic CIFAR10 dataset for the classification.
I have also used concepts such as:
1. Data normalization
2. Data augmentation
3. Residual connections
4. Batch normalization
5. Learning rate scheduling

I was able to achieve an accuracy of 90% for just 8 epochs.
Further, the model can be trained for more number of epochs for greater accuracy.
